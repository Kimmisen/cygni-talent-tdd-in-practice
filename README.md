# react-bdd

Welcome! Your assignment is to implement a simple Flickr image gallery using a TDD/BDD approach.

This project already contains a test suite using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), as well as some boilerplate code to quickly get API requests up and running.

## Requirements

- Node.js (>= 12)
- Visual Studio Code (preferred)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
